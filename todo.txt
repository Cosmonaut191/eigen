- we have `new-start` and `new-android` in package.json. we should merge. same for ios.
- for some reason, `tasks.whenTaskAdded` in `node_modules/react-native-config/android/dotenv.gradle` is not working.
  in upstream this function is deleted. in our fork we still have it. can we delete it? can we make it work?
- warn people that they should run `yarn cache clean` before running `yarn install:all`. we had some issues with master -> main for react-native-config
- for the old app, to install pods, we rename the new `ios` folder to `new-ios` temporarily.
- we have the metaflag `newIosAppShell` to know if we should start the new or old app
- we added yarn go-old and yarn go-new to control which app to run.
- updated react-native-config patch to get source directory correct in ios folder, should be able to remove when we have just one dir
- returning same modules for native for ios as android, many are broken and will need to be fixed, may want to distinguish Android and iOS still here
- adding placeholder constants for native module export to prevent crash - see ARTArtsyNativeModule.m, use real thing when we have access to old ios files
